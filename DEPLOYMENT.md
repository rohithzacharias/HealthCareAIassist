## 📱 PWA Installation Fix

The 404 error you're experiencing is because the PWA is trying to access files from a URL that doesn't exist. Here are several ways to fix this:

## 🌐 Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HealthCareAIassist.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Save

3. **Access your PWA:**
   - Your app will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/HealthCareAIassist/`
   - The PWA will work perfectly from this URL

## 🏠 Option 2: Local Development Server

1. **Install a local server:**
   ```bash
   # Using Python (if installed)
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Or using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Access via localhost:**
   - Open: `http://localhost:8000`
   - The PWA will work from this local URL

## 🔧 Option 3: Quick Fix for Current Installation

1. **Uninstall the current PWA:**
   - Long press the app icon on your phone
   - Select "Uninstall" or "Remove"

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Open browser settings
   - Clear cache and data for the site

3. **Reinstall from correct URL:**
   - Visit the correct URL (GitHub Pages or localhost)
   - Install the PWA again

## 📋 Files Updated for Fix

I've updated these files to work with relative paths:

- ✅ `manifest.json` - Changed start_url and scope to use `./`
- ✅ `sw.js` - Updated cache URLs and fallback handling
- ✅ `offline.html` - Added offline fallback page
- ✅ Service worker registration - Fixed path issues

## 🎯 Testing Steps

1. **Host the app properly** (GitHub Pages or local server)
2. **Open the correct URL** in your mobile browser
3. **Install the PWA** when prompted
4. **Test all features:**
   - Video learning
   - Quizzes
   - Articles
   - Progress tracking

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If you still get 404 errors:**

1. Check that all files are in the same directory
2. Ensure the server is serving files correctly
3. Try accessing `index.html` directly first
4. Check browser console for errors

**If PWA won't install:**

1. Make sure you're using HTTPS (or localhost)
2. Check that the manifest.json is accessible
3. Verify service worker is registered
4. Try in incognito mode

## 🎉 Expected Result

After proper deployment, your PWA should:
- ✅ Install without errors
- ✅ Open to the main dashboard
- ✅ Show all learning content
- ✅ Work offline
- ✅ Track progress properly
