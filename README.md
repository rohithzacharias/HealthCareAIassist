# 🎓 MedAide AI - AI-Powered Study Assistant

## 🎯 Problem Statement
**AI-Powered Study Assistant**: A lightweight personal digital assistant that:
1. **Recommends learning resources** based on student's topic + weak subtopics
2. **Generates break schedules** (Pomodoro or custom timing)
3. **Shows simple wellness tips** during scheduled breaks

## 🚀 Project Overview
MedAide AI is your **intelligent personal study companion** for ALL academic subjects. Students enter their own test scores, and our AI identifies weak areas to recommend targeted learning resources, creates smart study schedules with wellness breaks, and builds personalized learning paths.

## 🔄 **Student-Driven Workflow**

### **How Students Use MedAide AI:**
1. **Login & Subject Selection:** "What are you studying today?"
2. **Mark Entry:** Students enter their own test scores for different topics
3. **AI Analysis:** System identifies weak areas (scores < 60%)
4. **Smart Recommendations:** AI suggests resources based on low scores
5. **Study Session:** Creates timeline with wellness breaks
6. **Progress Tracking:** Students can update marks after new tests

### **Example Flow:**
```
Alex logs in → Selects "Computer Science" → Enters marks:
- Programming Basics: 38/100 ❌ (Needs immediate attention)
- Data Structures: 35/100 ❌ (Critical foundation gap)
- Algorithms: 42/100 ⚠️ (Below average)
- Database Systems: 67/100 ✅ (Good understanding)

AI Response: "I see you're struggling with programming fundamentals (38%). 
Let me recommend this beginner video that explains variables and loops step-by-step. 
Your visual learning style will benefit from the coding demonstrations."

Study Schedule Created:
├── Study: Programming Basics Video (25 min)
├── Break: 5-Minute Deep Breathing
├── Study: Data Structures Practice (25 min)
└── Break: Desk Stretches (5 min)
```

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 **1. Recommends Learning Resources Based on Student Marks**
- **Mark Analysis:** Students enter test scores, AI identifies weak subjects (< 60%)
- **Intelligent Matching:** Recommends resources based on performance gaps and learning style
- **Clear Reasoning:** Explains WHY each resource is recommended
- **Priority Ordering:** Lowest scores get highest priority recommendations

**Real Example:**
```
Student Mark Entry:
- Physics Mechanics: 45/100
- Algebra: 52/100
- Essay Writing: 38/100

AI Recommendations:
1. Essay Writing (38%) → "Academic Writing Guide" (Highest Priority)
2. Physics (45%) → "Mechanics Fundamentals Video" (High Priority)  
3. Algebra (52%) → "Problem-Solving Techniques" (Medium Priority)
```

### ⏰ **2. Generates Study Break Schedules**
- **Flexible Timing:** Pomodoro (25 min) or custom session lengths (30/45/60 min)
- **Wellness Integration:** Strategically timed breaks with health activities
- **Burnout Prevention:** Prevents study fatigue through scheduled self-care
- **Personal Preferences:** Adapts break activities to student preferences

**Example Schedule Generation:**
```
Student Request: 60-minute study session
AI-Generated Timeline:
├── Study Block: Essay Writing Guide (25 min)
├── Wellness Break: 5-Minute Deep Breathing (Physical preference)
├── Study Block: Physics Mechanics Video (25 min)
└── Physical Break: Desk Stretches (5 min)

Break Selection Logic:
- Student prefers "Physical" breaks → Movement-based activities
- After difficult topic → Stress relief breathing exercise
- After video content → Physical stretches for screen time
```

### 🧘 **3. Shows Simple Wellness Tips During Breaks**
- **Break Activities:** 10 wellness tips categorized by type and duration
- **Stress Management:** Breathing exercises, relaxation techniques
- **Physical Health:** Stretches, movement, eye rest for screen time
- **Study Optimization:** Active recall, environment tips, progress reflection

**Wellness Categories:**
- 🧘 **Mindfulness (5-10 min):** Deep breathing, progressive relaxation
- 🏃 **Physical (3-8 min):** Desk stretches, movement breaks, hydration
- 📚 **Study Techniques (5 min):** Active recall, progress review, planning

## 📚 **Universal Learning Resources (25 Total)**

### **All Academic Subjects Covered:**
- **🔬 Sciences:** Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Environmental Science
- **📊 Mathematics:** Algebra, Geometry, Statistics, Calculus

### **Smart Resource Matching:**
```python
# Rule-Based Recommendation Logic
def recommend_resource(student_marks, subject):
    for topic, score in student_marks.items():
        if score < 45:
            return get_resource(topic, difficulty="Beginner")
        elif score < 60:
            return get_resource(topic, difficulty="Intermediate") 
        # Score >= 60: Student is doing well, no recommendation needed
```

## 📊 **Student Data & Mark Entry System**

### **Student Profile Structure:**
```json
{
  "student_id": "S001",
  "name": "Alex Chen",
  "learning_style": "Visual Learner",
  "current_subject": "Computer Science",
  "performance": {
    "Programming Basics": 38,
    "Data Structures": 35,
    "Algorithms": 42,
    "Database Systems": 67
  },
  "study_preferences": {
    "session_length": 25,
    "content_types": ["Video", "Quiz"],
    "break_preference": "Physical"
  },
  "mark_entry_history": {
    "last_updated": "2025-10-08",
    "entry_method": "Student self-reported"
  }
}
```

### **Mark Entry Process:**
1. **Subject Selection:** Student chooses what they're studying
2. **Topic Identification:** System shows relevant topics for that subject
3. **Score Input:** Student enters marks out of 100 for each topic
4. **AI Analysis:** System identifies weak areas and recommends resources
5. **Progress Updates:** Students can re-enter marks after studying

## 🤖 **Rule-Based AI Intelligence**

### **Why Rule-Based Approach?**
- ✅ **Fast MVP Implementation:** No machine learning training required
- ✅ **Explainable Decisions:** Clear reasoning for every recommendation
- ✅ **Immediate Deployment:** Works instantly with student data
- ✅ **Reliable Performance:** Consistent results every time

### **Recommendation Logic:**
```
IF student_score < 45% THEN recommend "Beginner" difficulty resource
IF student_score 45-59% THEN recommend "Intermediate" difficulty resource  
IF student_score >= 60% THEN no recommendation needed (student doing well)

ADDITIONALLY:
- Match resource type to learning style (Visual → Videos, Reading/Writing → Articles)
- Prioritize lowest scores first
- Create study schedule with appropriate break activities
```
